Cosmetic Chemical Prediction

Overview
This project is a machine learning based system that predicts the chemical used in a cosmetic product using product, company, brand, and category information.
The prediction is provided through a Streamlit web application.

Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze cosmetic chemical data and build a predictive model that helps understand chemical usage patterns in cosmetic products.

Machine Learning Workflow
Data loading and cleaning
Dropping irrelevant columns
Exploratory data analysis
Label encoding of categorical features
Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler
Model training using Random Forest
Model evaluation
Prediction using a Streamlit interface

Model Information
The project uses a Random Forest Classifier.
Model and encoder files are not included in the repository due to GitHub file size limitations.
They can be generated by running the training notebook.

How to Run the Project
